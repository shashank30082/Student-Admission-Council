                    Placement Experience : Sem 6 makes the student ready for the outside world. Students start applying for internships in their interested companies and also studying at the same time. Around 60% get placed as an intern in some companies.</p>

                <h3>Ashish Bhatt</h3>
                <p>Rating: 7.3/10 stars</p>
                <p>Remarks : The college had good placement status. Startinh from the first year the college had a remarkable appearance. The campus wasn't that big. Students from Sports Quota may not be favourable as according to their future sports career. The faculty and teaching is very good.
                    Admission : No, there is no group discussion involved for the admission process. The students just needs to complete the CAP process for fitting in the admission criteria. Offline admission is also available here.</p>
