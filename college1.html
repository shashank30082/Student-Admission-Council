                    Placement Experience : VJTI's most highlighting point is the placements. you can be eligible for placements from your 4th year means the 7th semester, you can also apply for internships for the 3rd semester. all the top companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Deshaw, etc came here. our highest package is 68LPA and the average package is 8.5LPA. All the students get placed in the college, some can prepare for tech placements from core backgrounds. I have to work on my own start-up after completing my degree, before that during the college period for work experience I am doing internships.

Very Big Celebrities Have Performed At VJTI, Placements - This Also Is The Best In Any Govt Maharashtra College By Far., Students - The Students Here, Especially Seniors - They Lay Very Strong Foundation Of College Life And Academics.
                    Dislikes : Poor Looks - You Can't Judge A Book By It's Cover Tho, Hostel Infrastructure - It's Little Too Old.
                    Placement Experience : Best placements in Maharashtra are offered at VJTI ( second to IITB ofc). We become eligible for campus internships in the 5th sem and for campus placements, in the 7th sem. Most people get a Pre-placement offer directly after their internships. Specifically speaking of CS and IT, all 100% are placed this year. The rest of the placements are still going on, with an overall 80% already placed.</p>
