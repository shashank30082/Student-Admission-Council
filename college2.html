                <h3>Pranay Fadtare</h3>
                <p>Rating: 5 stars</p>
                <p>Our campus life is great.
                    Placements: Almost 100% of students got placed in this course. Top recruiting companies are Microsoft, Phone Pe, Deloitte, JP Morgan, etc. The highest salary package offered was 110 LPA. The average salary package offered was around 15.01 LPA. The minimum salary package offered was 12 LPA. Around 10% of students got internships in various companies. Others can also do research internships in various fields from IIT Bombay.
                    
                    Infrastructure: The infrastructure is good. Our college has 8-storeyed buildings. All facilities are good. Classrooms are air-conditioned. Projectors are available in our classrooms. Laboratories are also well maintained. The food served in the mess is decent. Canteen is available. Many students finish their lunch and tiffin having fun.
                    
                    Faculty: All teachers are experienced. They are Ph.D. scholars. The teaching quality is great for us to understand every topic easily. They always clarify our doubts. The course curriculum is relevant. It contains subjects like PSOOP. They also provide in-depth knowledge regarding 3D printing, graphics, etc.
                    
                    Other: I chose this course because of my interest in it. Our college provides good placements. I wish there should be more laboratory and practical sessions for coding language to help students clear the basics. There are 21 clubs in this college. Events and fests are conducted on our campus. Our campus is very beautiful. It is situated near the lake. Various scholarships are offered by SPIT to study abroad. They also conduct seminars to help students with their financial condition.</p>
