                <p>Rating: 9.3/10 stars</p>
                <p>Placement Experience : From 7,8 semesters students became eligible for placement and gets placed. Companies like TCS, Infosys, unacademy , Colgate, oracle, visits college's highest package is offered 3500000 and the average is 500000 and the lowest is 400000 above 80 percent of students gots placed. My plan is to do post graduate after getting a degree.
                    Remarks : To get eligible for this course we have to clear the HSC Maharashtra board with a minimum of 50 percent PCM subject and we have to give an entrance exam called mhtcet which application form can be obtained from mhtcet.org.in at an application fee of rs 850 no improvement is needed.</p>
